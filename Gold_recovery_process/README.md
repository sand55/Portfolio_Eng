# Project: "Development of a model for predicting the recovery factor of gold"

The goal of the work is to prepare a model for predicting the recovery factor of gold to optimize production.

The technological process is divided into two stages:

1. Flotation

A mixture of gold-bearing ore is fed into the flotation plant. After enrichment, a rough concentrate and “dump tails” are obtained, that is, product residues with a low concentration of valuable metals.
The stability of this process is affected by the unstable and non-optimal physical and chemical state of the flotation pulp (a mixture of solid particles and liquid).

2. Cleaning

The rougher concentrate goes through two stages of purification. The output is the final concentrate and new final tailings

When preparing the model, it is necessary to predict two quantities:

1. Efficiency of rougher concentrate enrichment;
2. Efficiency of enrichment of the final concentrate.

Basic steps:

- Data review and validation
- Data preparation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model training
- Testing the best model
- Conclusion
