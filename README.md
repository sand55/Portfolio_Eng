| 1 | [Study of the technological process of gold recovery](https://github.com/sand55/Portfolio_Eng/tree/main/Gold_recovery_process)| `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn` | Predict the concentration of gold during the gold recovery process.| A machine learning model is being built for an industrial company that develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial facility. The model should predict the gold recovery rate from gold based on data with mining and recovery parameters. The model will help optimize production| EDA, regression, custom metrics |
| 2 | [Steel melting temperature prediction]| `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `LightGBM`, `Catboost`| Preparing a Model for Predicting the Optimal Steel Melting Temperature | The metallurgical complex plans to optimize costs (reduce costs) by reducing the energy consumption of the facility. Taking into account the fact that metal melting is the most energy-intensive process , the goal is to predict the optimal metal melting temperature as one of the measures to regulate energy consumption. The main goal of the project is to prepare a model for predicting the optimal steel melting temperature (solution of the regression problem) with the required quality (metric) MAE | EDA, regression, MAE, hyperparameter selection, ML model selection
